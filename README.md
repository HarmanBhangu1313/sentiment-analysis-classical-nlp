# Sentiment Analysis using Classical NLP Techniques

## Overview
This project implements a **classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** for **sentiment analysis** on text data (restaurant reviews).  
The objective is to explore traditional NLP techniques and **compare multiple machine learning classifiers** using Bag-of-Words features.

This repository is **learning-oriented**, focusing on understanding text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation rather than using large pre-trained language models.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Stopword handling and stemming
- Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
- Train–test split
- Multiple ML classifiers for text classification
- Model comparison using evaluation metrics

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## NLP Pipeline
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, lowercasing, stemming)
2. Feature extraction using **Bag-of-Words**
3. Model training using multiple classifiers
4. Performance evaluation and comparison

---

## Models Evaluated
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

##  Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion matrices

A comparative analysis is performed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

---

##  Learning Outcome
This project strengthened understanding of:
- Classical NLP workflows
- Text feature engineering
- Differences between ML classifiers for NLP tasks
- Importance of evaluation beyond accuracy

---

##  Notes
- This is a **classical project**
- No word embeddings or transformer-based models are used
- Intended as a foundation before advanced NLP techniques
